8ch MOSFET:
  * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
  * busbar:
    * determine new hole spacing
    * design new model/dxf
    * switch to M4 holes
    * extend the busbar a little bit to fit 3mm case wall + MEGA or MBRF fuses
    * update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet

Brine-o-Matic 9000:
  * esp32-s3 module
  * 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
  

Input Board:
  * esp32-s3 module
  * 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
  * best ADC chip available
  * figure out how to support the widest variety of inputs
    * tank senders + voltage dividers

Electronics:

Long Term Ideas:
    * Relay board - DC or AC?
    * Motor driver / H bridge?
    * manual OTA upload
    * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit
