## Load Driver
  * double check INPUT circuit against VDO sender
  * double check voltage measurement
  * go over parts list
  * rename board
  * order parts
  * order board
  * update 3dp case

## Brine-o-Matic 9000:
  * esp32-s3 module
  * 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
  

## Input Board:
  * esp32-s3 module
  * 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
  * best ADC chip available
  * figure out how to support the widest variety of inputs
    * tank senders + voltage dividers

### Long Term Ideas:
  * Relay board - DC or AC?
  * Motor driver / H bridge?
  * manual OTA upload
  * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit
